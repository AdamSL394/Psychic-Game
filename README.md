# Psychic-Game

This Repo show the ability to combine CSS, HTML & Javascript. The main work is done by javascript.
We start by setting out an array of the alphabet which the computer will randomly choose a letter. Multiplying the number of choices by a number between 0-.99 and rounding down. Additionally we set variables for our wins, losses and guesses left which will all change as the script is run. Next we are looking to store the key the user presses, and check that it is alphabetical and not contained in past guesses. If it is incorrect we store it in guesses so far. From here we are going through if/else statements, depending on the letter and guesses left. We either record a correct response and win or an incorrect response and a possible loss. Lastly we add a function for resting the game depending if the user has won or lost.
